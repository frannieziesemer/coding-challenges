## coding-challenges
The aim of this repo is to store and demonstrate challenges I have completed in various programming languages. 
I complete coding challenges everyday on codewars.com, however I also complete some in this repo to also practice testing and documentation of my code.

You will find directories for each programming language which then contain a directory for each challenge. Each challenge directory with then contain a readme file outlining the challenge + psuedocode + relevante links, a file for the code and a file containing the tests completed.
